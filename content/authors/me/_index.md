I am a 3-year PhD student in Computer Science at the **ETH Zurich**, under the supervision of Prof. **Florian Tramèr**, and a member of the **Secure and Private AI (SPY) Lab**.

My primary focus is on examining the potential **security and privacy risks in ML systems**, both in their current state and as they evolve in the future. My research aims to uncover vulnerabilities and develop strategies to mitigate these risks, ultimately contributing to the development of more secure and privacy-preserving machine learning technologies.

I completed my master's degree in Software Engineering at **Zhejiang University** in March 2023, advised by Prof. **Chao Wu**. Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree at Hainan University in July 2020.
